# Kindista Privacy Policy 

## Information we collect and how we use it

We may collect the following types of information:
  
  - **Information you provide.** 
    Kindista is generally intended as a tool to post information publicly,
    therefore, with the exceptions listed below, information you post to
    Kindista is generally viewable to anyone using the Site.

    - **Profile Picture and Display Name.** 
      Your profile picture and display name will be shown on your 
      profile and will be accessible to anyone using the Site. 
    - **Email Addresses.**
      Your email addresses are not displayed to other users on the Site. 
      However, if other users already know your email address (e.g. your
      friends and family), they can use your email address to search for
      your profile or send you messages.
    - **Physical Address.**
      We ask you to provide your physical address so that we can
      provide you and other users with geographically relevant content.
      When other users view content that you post to the site, we will
      only show them the approximate distance to your physical address. 
      *To protect your privacy, we do not disclose the exact location of 
      your physical address.*
    - **Messages**
      Messages you send to other Users are viewable only by recipients
      of those messages. When the message is part of a group
      conversation, the message is viewable by all users listed as 
      participants of the conversation.
    - **Other User Content.**
      Other than the information described above, User Content -
      including Resources, Requests, your profile bio section, expressions 
      of gratitude, announcements, and events - is generally viewable by 
      anyone using the site. 
      *Unless we explicitly provide you with a mechanism to restrict who can 
      see the Content you post, you can assume that it is publicly
      viewable.*

  - **Relational information.**
    All of the personal information you provide may also be linked to 
    "relational data" - such as your membership in certain groups you
    may join on the Site.
    Unless otherwise indicated, all of this relational data is public and 
    viewable to anyone using the Site.

  - **Log information.** 
    When you access Kindista via a browser, application or other client our 
    servers automatically record certain information. 
    These server logs may include information such as your web request, your 
    interaction with the Site, Internet Protocol address, browser type, 
    browser language, and the date and time of your request.

  - **User communications.** 
    When you send email or other communications to Kindista, we may retain 
    those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to 
    your requests and improve our services. 
    When you send communications to other Users, our system may retain those 
    communications indefinitely so that the parties with whom communicate 
    will have a record of your communication. 
    We may use your email address to communicate with you about our services. 
    You may change your communications preferences on your profile settings 
    page.

  - **Location data.**
    Kindista offers location-enabled search results and the ability to find 
    nearby users. 
    When using the Site, Kindista may receive information about your actual 
    location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information 
    that can be used to approximate a location.

In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:
1. provide, maintain, protect and improve our services; 
1. develop new services; and 
1. protect the rights of other users, Kindista, or Kindista's parent organization, CommonGoods Network. 

## Information Sharing

Kindista only shares personal information with other entities or individuals 
outside of Kindista in the following limited circumstances:

  - When we have your explicit pre-approval to do so. 
  
  - When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or 
    disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: 
    1. satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable 
    government request;
    1. enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigations of potential 
    violations thereof; 
    1. detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical 
    issues; or 
    1. protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of CommonGoods 
    Network, Kindista, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We do not currently have any agreements with third-parties that would 
necessitate sharing your personal information. 
If we offer services in the future that would necessitate sharing your 
sensitive personal information with third-parties, we will require opt-in 
consent for sharing such information.

## Modifying or deleting personal information.

Personal information, such as your display name, communications preferences, 
profile picture, primary email address, city, and state or province can be 
edited on your settings page. User Content - including Resources,
Requests, and statements of Gratitude - can be edited or deleted on
pages on which that Content is displayed. 

Because Kindista functions as a community identity and reputation system, we 
have special policies regarding certain personally identifiable information.
If you use the Site, your identity will be linked to the expressions of 
Graditude you give to, or receive from, other users. 
Other users will use the Site to develop a reputation of community generosity 
and trust through the Gratitude you share about them. 
That reputation is only valuable for other users if the expressions of  you 
receive are permanently linked with your identity. 

Your display name, your primary email address, and your profile picture are
part of your searchable identity which is linked to messages you have sent 
to, and gratitude you have posted about, other users.
<u>Therefore, you will not be able to delete your display name, your 
primary email address, or your profile picture from our servers even if you 
deactivate your account.</u>


## Other sites. 

This Privacy Policy applies to Kindista services only.
We do not exercise control over links to other sites that are provided by 
other users. 
These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your 
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
