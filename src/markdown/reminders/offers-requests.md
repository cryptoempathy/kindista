We are happy you have joined Kindista and taken your first step into the Sharing Economy!
We invite you to take the next step and post some offers and requests; so you can further enrich your life, as well as well as your community and the lives of those around you.

Here are some tips to help you get started:

## OFFERS

Some people feel like they don't have much to offer, but that is almost never true. Here are some things to look at:

- What items do I have around my home, that I would just as soon let go of, but might be of real value to someone else?
- What tools, entertainment items, kitchen equipment, etc. do I have and rarely use, that I could easily loan to others, especially those in my neighborhood?
- What information do I have that many people don't and might be useful for them? Almost everyone has one or two areas where they are "experts" and that information can be a real gift for others.
- What services and skills do I enjoy giving to others?

Remember, posting an offer
[doesn't create an obligation](https://kindista.org/faq#am-i-obligated-to-give-an-offer) 
to give anything; you can always say no when someone asks for what
you've offered.
We encourage you to set the boundaries that make giving work for you.
We want this to feel as safe and easy as possible.

## REQUESTS

Asking for things you need is a gift to others; it gives them the
opportunity to give and make a difference in your life.
Many people don't have easy ways to do that in their lives.
Asking for help builds trust and enables us to feel more connected, and can result in us feeling more energized to give to others out of our abundance.
So ask!

Here are some specific areas where you can ask for what you want:
- Many of us are in the habit of every time we need something, just going out and buying it.
_Make a new habit._
When you need something, let your first step be asking the question,
"Can I get this from my community as a gift or a borrow?"
Maybe you won't need to buy that tool, lawnmower, DVD player, etc.
- If you are a person who is short on time, even so short that posting on Kindista might feel like a chore, think of what could save you time.
Could someone pick up your kids weekly for that one trip that is so inconvenient?
Can someone shop for you at that store that is so out of your way?
Be creative and ask for anything that costs you time and does not feel fun to do.
- Is there an area where you feel stuck, and someone with the right knowledge or wisdom could help get you on track?
There are people in your community that can help you organize and clarify as well as have specialized knowledge you might need.

## HELPFUL TIPS

If you are a person with very little time and a comfortable amount of
money, feel free to share money with other people on Kindista by
contacting them through their profiles.
You can share money in appreciation of gifts received, or just because you honor what they are doing for others.
We are moving beyond a system dependent on money, but it is still a need for many of us, and something you can share,

When posting offers, it's always a good idea to search requests to see
if someone you might want to share with is already requesting what you
are offering.
Likewise, when posting requests, check to see if what you want is
already being offered by someone.
