It looks like it's been a while since you posted any new offers on
Kindista.

Remember, the more resources we offer to our community, the more we
will inspire others to offer what they have to us.
Together, we have more than enough for all of us to live truly
rich and abundant lives.
As a culture, we just need to learn to share more fully.

## Help create a world where all of our gifts are fully expressed and all of our deepest needs are met.

It's up to each of us to open ourselves to more fully sharing our
countless gifts with our community.
Together we can create the more beautiful world our hearts know is
possible.
So what are you waiting for?
Go ahead and [post some new offers](https://kindista.org/offers/new)!

Need some help coming up with new ideas of things you can offer?
Here are some tips:

- What items do I have around my home, that I would just as soon let go of, but might be of real value to someone else?
- What tools, entertainment items, kitchen equipment, etc. do I have and rarely use, that I could easily loan to others, especially those in my neighborhood?
- What information do I have that many people don't and might be useful for them? Almost everyone has one or two areas where they are "experts" and that information can be a real gift for others.
- What services and skills do I enjoy giving to others?

Get creative! You can offer tutoring, household
items, food, clothing, or the temporary use of vehicles, work space, or
housing. Anything you have that is underutilized, or that might be
useful or appreciated by someone else.

If you are a person with very little time and a comfortable amount of
money, feel free to share money with other people on Kindista by
contacting them through their profiles.
You can share money in appreciation of gifts received, or just because you honor what they are doing for others.
We are moving beyond a system dependent on money, but it is still a need for many of us, and something you can share,

If you're still not sure what to you have to share, try looking through the [requests on Kindista](https://kindista.org/requests) to see what kinds of things would be useful to others in your community.

Remember, posting an offer
[doesn't create an obligation](https://kindista.org/faq#am-i-obligated-to-give-an-offer) 
to give anything; you can always say no when someone asks for what
you've offered.
We encourage you to set the boundaries that make giving work for you.
We want this to feel as safe and easy as possible.

As always, when you post an offer it's a good idea to search requests to
see if someone who you might want to share with is already requesting what you are offering.
