Can you think of anyone else to invite who would benefit from, or might
have some useful resources to offer your local Kindista community?

The more people you can encourage to join Kindista, the more useful it will be for you.

- [Invite](https://kindista.org/invite) your neighbors to find out what kinds of skill-sharing and tool-sharing opportunities are available right next door.
- [Invite](https://kindista.org/invite) friends from your social groups or faith communities and post
statements of gratitude about them to encourage other Kindistas to share
with them.
- [Invite](https://kindista.org/invite) people who are making a
  difference in your life and who you would like to honor by sharing
  gratitude about them on Kindista.
- [Invite](https://kindista.org/invite) your friends living in other communities to help seed Kindista around
the world and open up more sharing opportunities for when you travel or move
to a new city.

We want Kindista to spread like wildfire to build a global culture of
sharing and gratitude, and we need your help.
