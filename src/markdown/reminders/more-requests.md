It looks like it's been a while since you posted any new requests on
Kindista.

We're trying to create a culture where we can all get more of our needs
met through sharing.
One way to make that happen is by letting our community know what we
need.

## Can you think of anything that would make your life easier or more enjoyable that you haven't already asked for on Kindista?

Asking for things you need is a gift to others; it gives them the
opportunity to give and make a difference in your life.
Many people don't have easy ways to do that in their lives.
Asking for help builds trust and enables us to feel more connected, and can result in us feeling more energized to give to others out of our abundance.
So go ahead and [post some new requests](https://kindista.org/requests/new)!

Here are some specific areas where you can ask for what you want:
- Many of us are in the habit of every time we need something, just going out and buying it.
_Make a new habit._
When you need something, let your first step be asking the question, "Can I get this from my community as a gift or a borrow?
Maybe you won't need to buy that tool, lawnmower, DVD player, etc.
- If you are a person who is short on time, even so short that posting on Kindista might feel like a chore, think of what could save you time.
Could someone pick up your kids weekly for that one trip that is so inconvenient?
Can someone shop for you at that store that is so out of your way?
Be creative and ask for anything that costs you time and does not feel fun to do.
- Is there an area where you feel stuck, and someone with the right knowledge or wisdom could help get you on track?
There are people in your community that can help you organize and clarify as well as have specialized knowledge you might need.

And remember, when you post an request it's always a good idea to search offers to see if someone is already offering what you are looking for.
