## Post some offers

Kindista is all about getting more of our needs met through sharing.
The more resources you offer to your community, the more you will
inspire others to offer what they have to you.

Get creative! You can offer skills, tutoring, clothing, household
items, food, or the temporary use of vehicles, tools, work space, or
housing. Anything you have that is underutilized, or that might be
useful or appreciated by someone else.

If you're still not sure what to you have to share, try looking through the [requests on Kindista](https://kindista.org/requests) to see what kinds of things would be useful to others in your community.

Remember, posting an offer
[doesn't create an obligation](https://kindista.org/faq#am-i-obligated-to-give-an-offer) 
to give anything; you can always say no when someone asks for what
you've offered.

Also, when you post an offer it's always a good idea to search requests to see
if someone who you might want to share with is already requesting what you are offering.
