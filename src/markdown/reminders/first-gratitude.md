## Express gratitude for the people who are making a difference in your community

An attitude of gratitude creates joy, peace, and flow in our lives.
Publicly sharing our gratitude for the people making a difference in
our lives is a powerful act towards building a global sharing culture.
It lets people know that the gifts that they give are deeply
appreciated.
It encourages them to be even more generous.
And it also helps people new to sharing culture feel like they are part
of something bigger than themselves.
_Plus, it just simply feels good!_

When you have time, please take a few minutes to 
[share some gratitude](https://kindista.org/gratitude/new) on
Kindista.

- Thank people for sharing their time and energy with you in your times
  of need.
- Thank people for giving or lending you items so you don't have to buy
  them for yourself.
- Thank people for volunteering their time at non-profits or in
  community projects that are helping create the more beautiful world our 
  hearts know is possible.
- Edit statements of gratitude you have already posted to reflect recent
  sharing by people you have already thanked.
- And of course, thank anyone who has directly shared with you through
  Kindista, whom you might not have thanked at the time.

If a person who you want to thank isn't already on Kindista,
[please invite them](https://kindista.org/invite) to join our community!
