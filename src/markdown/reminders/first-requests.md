## Post some requests

Many people don't know what they have to offer the world until they see someone else in need.
Asking for things you need can be a gift to them; it gives them the opportunity to give and make a difference in your life.
This simple act can provide them with a deep sense of meaning and belonging.

Here are some specific areas where you can ask for what you want:
- Many of us are in the habit of every time we need something, just going out and buying it.
_Make a new habit._
When you need something, let your first step be asking the question, "Can I get this from my community as a gift or a borrow?
Maybe you won't need to buy that tool, lawnmower, DVD player, etc.
- If you are a person who is short on time, even so short that posting on Kindista might feel like a chore, think of what could save you time.
Could someone pick up your kids weekly for that one trip that is so inconvenient?
Can someone shop for you at that store that is so out of your way?
Be creative and ask for anything that costs you time and does not feel fun to do.
- Is there an area where you feel stuck, and someone with the right knowledge or wisdom could help get you on track?
There are people in your community that can help you organize and clarify as well as have specialized knowledge you might need.


Also, when you post an request it's always a good idea to search offers to see if someone is already offering what you are looking for.
